Hi,

I am working as a software developer on a large-scale C++ industrial application to model
electromagnetic phenomena.

I've received my masters in physics and astronomy from the _University of Heidelberg_ working
in the field of relativistic astrophysics were our group numerically modeled accretion discs
around compact objects.

I've obtained my PhD from the _Kyoto University_ in the field of plasma physics, where I've
developed a numerical code to research the interplay between turbulence of various scales
within fusion devices.

If not at working or leisure I either dive into the exciting world of new technology,
or following my long term interests of computer architectures, high-performance
computing, and (a bit crazy) superluminal technologies.
